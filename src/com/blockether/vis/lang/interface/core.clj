  "The language surface: one stable set of tools — FORMAT / LINT / TEST /
   REPL_EVAL / REPL lifecycle — dispatched to whichever language pack owns the
   requested language.

   A pack is an ordinary Vis extension that carries handlers under
   `:ext/language-tools`; `register-pack!` registers one. This library owns the
   bare tool names, their descriptions, their Activity presentation, the
   capability matrix in the system prompt and the REPL lifecycle. A pack owns
   only the work behind a capability, so nothing here knows any language.

   REPL lifecycle is resource backed: `repl_start` creates a language-owned
   session resource, `repl_status` reports it and `repl_stop` ends one. Live
   REPLs also surface in the ctx `resources` block."
